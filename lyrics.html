                Behold our beloved revels in tragedy (in tragedy)
                Self-denying avarice for bloodshed, behold
                Hypocrite
                Those who run will be burned
                Those who run will be burned
                Those who run will be burned
                Those who run will be burned

                Devoutly wished for blinded eyes
                This tragedy's like light to flies
                It seems to suit you better
                Bleeding out the eyes (bleeding out the eyes)
                Hopes left in chain suspension
                Holding onto lies to make the truth
